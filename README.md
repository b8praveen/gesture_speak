# Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning  

## ðŸ“– Overview  
This project aims to bridge the communication gap for the hearing-impaired community by developing a **real-time sign language detection system**. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and advanced machine learning techniques, the system accurately recognizes and interprets sign language gestures into text or speech.  

## âœ¨ Features  
- **Real-Time Detection:** Fast and efficient gesture recognition.  
- **High Accuracy:** Optimized CNN model for robust predictions.  
- **Customizable Dataset:** Flexible support for adding new gestures.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and simple interface for interaction.  
- **Speech Integration (Optional):** Converts recognized gestures into audible speech.  

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow   
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV  
- **Dataset:** Custom-built
